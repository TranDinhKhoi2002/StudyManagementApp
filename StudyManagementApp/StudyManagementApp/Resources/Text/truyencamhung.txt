The limits of my language mean the limits of my world
To have another language is to possess a second soul
A different language is a different vision of life
With languages, you are at home anywhere
Knowledge of languages is the doorway to wisdom
The best way to predict the future is to create it
You just can't beat the person who won't give up
Genius is 1% talent and 99% percent hard work
There is no substitute for hard work
Today a reader, tomorrow a leader
The secret of getting ahead is getting started
If you can dream it, you can do it 
No one can make you feel inferior without your consent
Donâ€™t stop when you are tired. Stop when you are done
The best way to predict the future is to create it
Where there is a will, there is a way
Life is not fair, get used to it
Change your thoughts and you change your world
